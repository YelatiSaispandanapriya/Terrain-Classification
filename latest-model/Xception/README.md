### Xception_V1 - Terrain Classifier
-This project employs the Xception architecture from Keras for identifying different types of terrain images.
-The transfer learning approach demonstrates superior performance compared to earlier convolutional neural network implementations.

### Architecture
-The model utilizes a pre-trained Xception network as the base, originally trained on ImageNet.
-Custom modifications include:
-GlobalAveragePooling layer for dimensionality reduction
-Dense layer with 1024 neurons and ReLU activation function
-Final Dense layer with softmax activation, configured for the number of terrain classes

### Performance
-Comprehensive evaluation on the test dataset yielded the following results:
-Overall accuracy: 92.8% on the test set
-Additional evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix for detailed performance analysis

### Notes
-Key implementation details and training considerations:
-All input images were preprocessed and resized to 150Ã—150 pixel dimensions
-Training optimization employed EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau callbacks
-The dataset utilized is identical to that specified in the original repository
