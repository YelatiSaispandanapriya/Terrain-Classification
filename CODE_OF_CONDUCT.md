# Code of Conduct

</div>

### Our Commitment

We, as community members, contributors, and coordinators, are dedicated to maintaining a welcoming, respectful, and safe environment for all participants. We pledge to ensure that everyone can take part without fear of harassment or discrimination, regardless of age, body type, abilities, cultural background, gender identity or expression, expertise, education, financial status, nationality, physical appearance, race, faith, or sexual orientation.

### Expectations

Behaviors that foster positivity within our community include:

- Using language that is friendly and inviting  
- Valuing diverse perspectives and experiences  
- Responding to constructive feedback with grace  
- Placing the community’s interests first  
- Demonstrating empathy toward peers

Behaviors that will not be tolerated comprise:

- Sexualized comments, imagery, or any unwanted advances  
- Insults, derogatory remarks, trolling, or personal/political attacks  
- Public or private harassment of any kind  
- Sharing someone’s private information (such as addresses) without consent  
- Any other activity that could be considered inappropriate or unprofessional

### Roles and Duties

It is the responsibility of project maintainers to set clear expectations for positive conduct and to address any infractions with appropriate and impartial actions.

Maintainers are empowered and obliged to delete, modify, or reject contributions—such as comments, commits, edits, issues, or other content—that violate these standards. By embracing this Code of Conduct, maintainers agree to enforce these principles fairly and evenly across all aspects of project stewardship.

### Application

This code covers interactions within official project channels as well as situations where individuals represent the project in public. This includes using project-affiliated email addresses, posting from official social accounts, or acting as project delegates at events, whether online or in person.

### Reporting and Response

Any abuse, harassment, or other unacceptable conduct should be reported to the project team at [drakathakash@gmail.com](drakathakash@gmail.com). Every report will be reviewed, investigated, and addressed with an appropriate response, with confidentiality maintained for anyone submitting a report.
